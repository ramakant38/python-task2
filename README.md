# Assignment 1
- take a number as input from keyboard.
- store the input in a variable 'num'.
- use the if..else control statement with condition 'num % 2 == 0'.
- if the condition will true for the input value then it will execute the if block and print 'num' is a even number.
- if the condition will false for the input value then it will execute the else block and print 'num' is a odd number.

# Assignment 2
- take a variable 'sum' and initialize it with value 0.
- then use the for loop and 'i' as local variable.
- then by using range(start,stop) function give two argument i.e start=1 and stop=51.
- give the expression 'sum += i' inside the scope of for loop.
- when we execute the program, for loop will run and each time a single value will asign to 'i' then expression inside for loop will execute.
- the loop will execute upto the value of 'i' is 50 , at value 51 loop will terminate.
- after this the value of sum will print
